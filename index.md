# EU citizens: How to vote in European elections 2019?

### Do you want to elect your representative in the European Parliament?

EU citizens living in Germany can chose a Member of Parliament in the European elections on May 26, 2019. 

### I am not German. Can I still vote in Germany? 

**YES!** If you are an *EU citizen* and have lived in Germany for at least 3 months, *you can vote* in these elections. 
As long as you have done your residence registration (Anmeldung), you have the right to vote.

## REGISTRATION CLOSES ON MAY 5!

You just need to file an application form in your district office – for example, Bezirksamt Neukölln. 
You have to go there in person with your ID and the completed application form.

## Can I also vote in my Embassy?

You can only vote once. So you either vote in Germany or in your embassy. In Germany you vote for candidates
representing Germany, and in your embassy for people representing your home country. But you can only vote once!
